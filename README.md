# JioInsights

Implemented the Login and Logout functionality as for application flow.

By using the users endpoint, application can be authenticated.

After login, there will be a dropdown for selecting the companies based on the selection, the company details will be displayed. But there for two companies, logo link is not working.

Implemented the view all companies page for listing all the companies data in a grid manner.

But there is no relation between companies and contact API. I need a clarification to creating,updating and deleting a form. Also there is no API for this implementation.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.
